#### **Overview**

The CI/CD pipeline automates the process of linting, formatting, testing, scanning, building, and deploying the application. It ensures code quality and security while providing a streamlined deployment mechanism.

The pipeline is implemented using **GitHub Actions**, triggered on:
- **Push events** to the `main` branch.
- **Pull requests** targeting the `main` branch.
